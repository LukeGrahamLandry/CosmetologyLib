# Contributing

PRs for roadmap features or anything else you think would be cool are always welcome!

- By making a PR you're releasing your code under this repository's license (MIT). 
- In general I care about backwards compatibility. 
    - Try to make the use of new features optional. 
    - Add config flags (at the lowest level of abstraction that makes sense) when changing an existing feature.
- Ease of porting to other mod loaders is important. 
    - Please abstract platform api calls to services. 
- Feel free to [contact me](https://moddingtutorials.org/discord) to discuss your ideas before spending time on a PR.
